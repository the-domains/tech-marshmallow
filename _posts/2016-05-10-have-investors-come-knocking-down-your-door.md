Have investors come knocking down your door. 

You have a bad ass idea and ready to share it with the world. Your tech is put and the plan is laid out for the VC's. There is one small last hiccup: where ARE the investors?

Pour yourself a giant cup of coffee and add some stevia to it, not sugar...that sh\*t is bad for your health and lets figure this out. First, you don't have to be famous, spend a ton of money in advertising, or have a rolodex with important names on your desk to get the attention of VC's.

How else will you get noticed, make them trust you or get them excited about your startup idea, you ask?

Well, I'm glad you did, you tech marshmallow.
